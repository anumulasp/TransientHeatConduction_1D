# TransientHeatConduction_1D
This repository contains the code with which one can solve the transient heat conduction in a one-dimensional bar.

The code uses finite volume method to breakdown the domain and also uses explicit time stepping.
The importdata file can be used for post processing either through matlab or octave.
